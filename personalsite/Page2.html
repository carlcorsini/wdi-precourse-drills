      <h3>Time For A Change of Scenery</h3>
      <p>I have always been interested in computer programming.
         Since I was young computers just made sense to me.
         I was the IT helper around the house, and I learned everything by exploring.
         The limitless nature of computers has always fascinated me.
         But my knowledge is not as complete as I would like it to be, but
         I wanted to change careers and this seemed like a great step.
         I had the opportunity to attend in San Francisco, the tech capitol of the world, so I took it.
         <br>

         I would definitely consider myself a beginner in terms of coding or programming.
         And at this point I am not sure where I would like to specialize in the field.
         I was running social media for a restaraunt group in Boulder, taking photos and posting, doing some analytics
         but it was basically all user based.
         I wanted to see what was happening behind the website. I want to become more than just a user.
         I hope to land a job as a web developer, but I am open to whoever wants to take me in.
         <br>
         <br>
         Some ideas would be for a DAW company like Ableton or Propellerhead, but those specific companies are based in europe
         so that might not be the most realistic idea. I have a huge interest in music, and the industry has become much more digitalized and
         available to the average joe.
         I am also a big sports nerd, so using my development skills to work with sports analytics or fantasy sites would be interesting as well.
         At the very least I will know something I did not know before, and be able to use that in my small business idea of managing social media
         departments for small businesses or something along those lines.
         <br>
         <br>
         I started as a bus boy at a restaurant in Boulder with no knowledge of how to run a restaurant,
         and worked my way up to the top.
         I feel I am right back to the bottom again. I am daunted, nervous and excited. Life is too short just to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVtpXvzzXiA">get by</a>,
         and this is my way of taking a leap of faith.
         <br>

         Here is a gif that describes my feelings of starting this new path:
