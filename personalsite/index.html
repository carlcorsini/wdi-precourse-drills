        <h3>Howdy!</h3>
        <p>My name is Carl Corsini. I grew up in San Rafael, CA.
          My most recent form of education was at Front Range Community College in Boulder, Colorado.
          I have spent the last 6-7 years in Colorado, snowboarding, working in restaurants, and having the time of my life.
          I worked my way up to management and realized the career was not for me.
          So I moved back home to Mom's house, and I am embarking on a new journey.
